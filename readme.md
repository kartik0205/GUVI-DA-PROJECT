# 🎓 Student Dropout Risk Prediction using Data Analytics

This project uses **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to predict the likelihood of student dropout based on various academic, 
demographic, and behavioral factors. The project aligns with educational outcomes focused on data preprocessing, visualization, and ethical data practices.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Student-Dropout-Prediction.git
cd Student-Dropout-Prediction
2. Install Requirements
Use a virtual environment or install dependencies globally:


pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run EDA
You can run the EDA either as a notebook or Python script:

Notebook (Recommended for exploration):


jupyter notebook notebooks/01_data_preprocessing.ipynb
Script (Quick run):


python scripts/eda_pipeline.py
🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy
